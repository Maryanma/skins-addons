    "biographie":"Issu d'une famille de comédiens, Rutger Hauer connaît une enfance agitée durant laquelle il commet de nombreux délits. A l'âge de 15 ans, il fugue et parcourt le monde à bord d'un bâteau de marchandises. Il s'assagit et entame des études qu'il abandonne rapidement pour vagabonder, écrire de la poésie et profiter de la vie. Il se lance dans le cinéma en interprétant un petit rôle dans Monsieur Hawarden (1968) de Harry Kumel et se fait connaître du grand public hollandais avec la série télévisée Floris. Il y rencontre Paul Verhoeven et tourne avec lui Turkish delices (1973). Ce film, qui parle de sexualité et de fantasmes de façon très crue, reçoit un très bon accueil critique. Leur collaboration se poursuit avec Le Choix du destin (1977), Spetters (1980) et le moyenâgeux La Chair et le sang (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n En 1981, Rutger Hauer s'envole aux Etats-Unis pour y affronter Sylvester Stallone dans le film policier Les Faucons de la nuit et Harrison Ford dans le film de science-fiction de Ridley Scott, Blade runner (1982). Souvent cantonné dans des rôles de psychopathes (Hitcher, Que la chasse commence !), cet acteur aux traits germaniques sait également tirer profit de son physique athlétique pour tenir la vedette de quelques thrillers d'action comme Osterman week-end (1983) de Sam Peckinpah et Vengeance aveugle (1987), où il campe un justicier expert en arts martiaux, et du fantastique Ladyhawke, la femme de la nuit (1985), où il fait figure de chevalier héroïque.\r\n\r\n\r\n A partir des années 90, Rutger Hauer s'illustre dans de nombreuses séries B destinées uniquement au circuit vidéo comme Turbulences 3 (2000), mais il apparaît également dans des films où on ne l'attend pas comme Simon le Magicien (2000), où il incarne un comte passionné de poésie. Quelques réalisateurs le sortent toutefois de l'oubli comme George Clooney, qui en fait un tueur à gages est-allemand dans Confessions d'un homme dangereux (2002), et Robert Rodriguez qui l'imagine en prêtre cannibale dans Sin City (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nTournant beaucoup dans des films souvent inconnus du public français, Rutger Hauer goûte surtout à l'horreur (Minotaur, 7eventy 5ive, Le Rite, Dracula, The Reverend), mais s'illustre aussi dans des drames (Mentor, Oogverblindend), des comédies (Moving McAllister, Magic Flute Diaries, Célibataires et en cavale) et des films d'action (Barberousse, l'empereur de la mort, Rescue Team, Real Playing Game, Le Roi Scorpion 4 - La quête du pouvoir). En 2017, le comédien âgé de 73 ans livre une prestation inattendue dans la comédie française Gangsterdam portée par Kev Adams et incarne le Président de la Fédération Humaine dans le blockbuster Valérian et la Cité des Mille Planètes. Il entame 2018 avec le thriller d'action 24H Limit aux côtés d'Ethan Hawke.",

On October 14, 1943, members of the camp's underground resistance succeeded in covertly killing eleven German officers and a number of Ukrainian guards. Of the 600 inmates in the camp, roughly 300 escaped, although most were later re-captured and killed. The escape forced the Nazis to close the death camp, dismantling it and planting a forest.",

Dick and the origins of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  Interweaved are cast interviews with the notable exceptions of Harrison Ford and Sean Young. Through these interviews we get a sense of how difficult and frustrating the film was to make as a result of an exacting director without allies and hot, wet, smoggy conditions; which added to the high pressure atmosphere everyone increasingly felt as the film went over budget.  There is also a tour of some locations, most notably the Bradbury Building and the Warner Brothers backlot that was the LA 2019 streets, which look very different from Ridley's dark version.",

Dick’s oeuvre foretold the world that has become our own today. The film will take the viewer on a fascinating journey to discover this extraordinary writer and to observe our contemporary society with a critical eye by delving into three of K.

At summer's end, when she is 17, Mariette Baptiste, educated daughter of the local doctor, enters the cloistered convent of Our Lady of the Afflictions as a postulant. Her religious fervor, understated but determined, makes an impact on the small community of nuns whose days and nights are measured in a round of prayer and farm work changing only with the seasons. Their ordered life is disrupted, however, as Mariette begins to fall into a series of trances from which she awakens with stigmata, which heal as spontaneously as they appear. The feelings of skepticism, jealousy and adoration evoked in the nuns, Mariette's own response and that of the Mother Superior are delicately, indelibly presented.",

The feature was made technically possible using digital microwave link technology provided by Rear Window Television with the 'spontaneous' webcam feature always produced as a full quality Outside Broadcast, before being made to look like a traditional webcam at the studios.\n\nThe most often repeated moment involved Graham and Dustin Hoffman interacting live with a passenger of a London taxi cab driving through the city.\n\nV Graham Norton is available on 4oD through Virgin Media, but not through the PC.",

            "overview":"Merlin is a television miniseries which originally aired in 1998 that retells the legend of King Arthur from the perspective of the wizard Merlin. Sam Neill stars in the title role in a story that covers not only the rise and fall of Camelot but also the phase in the legendary history of Britain that precedes it.\n\nThe film deviates from more traditional versions of the legend, notably by including new characters such as Queen Mab and by keeping Merlin through the whole reign of King Arthur over Britain. The film was followed by a sequel in 2006, Merlin's Apprentice, which was more loosely connected with traditional Arthurian legend.",
